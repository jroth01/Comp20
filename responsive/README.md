# Implementation
I believe I correctly used media queries to adjust the background-position 
property of the "homer.jpg" background-image. 

The adjustment between the four images in the sprite sheet is not quite as 
smooth as I'd like - the amount of white space surrounding the image changes
each time the sprite changes. 

# Collaboration
I checked StackOverflow and found this post to be particularly helpful:
